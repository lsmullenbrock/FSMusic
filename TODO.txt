VISUAL STUDIO DOES NOT SUPPORT TASKS FOR F#
WHY?!?!?!

@TODO TimeSigs
Get TimeSigs to draw properly

@TODO Accidentals
Major work to be done here. Not even implemented in drawing whatsoever.
Must be a DependentEvent, where origin=target.

@TODO Keysigs
Major work for drawing keysigs based on Accidentals

@TODO Multiple measures per staff
Major rework will need to be done for assuring clefs, ties, keysigs etc
will carry over from measure to measure.

@TODO Slurs
Extend ties into slurs.
Rework origin/target into a list of targets?
Slurs will need a lot of geometric mangling to get them to work.
Put on back burner for now.

@TODO Multiple staves
Long-term goal.

@HACK EventID
Implemented with EventIDManager.
Will need to revisit later to make more robust.
