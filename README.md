# FSMusic_Test1
A toy music engraving program written in F#.
Not meant for anything other than toy use.
Meant to be "dumb" i.e., only draws what it is told to draw with minimal complaints.
Will add section on adding music objects to canvas.

Simply run in Visual Studio or build/run in VS Code.
To demo, just run and hit the "Draw Exercise" button.

line_counter.exe is exactly what it says it is (because Visual Studio does NOT have built-in analysis for F# projects...)
Source for it can be found here: https://gist.github.com/lsmullenbrock/a8b1d69a63890cf3dc76f6ebf1240ada
